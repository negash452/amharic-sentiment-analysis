This folder contains the extracted twitter data based on the data given in the data folder. 
The data folder only contained twitter_id and sentiment, and I used twitter API to extract the tweets for each given id and add it to the dataset for my sentiment analysis.

The script to extract the tweet is located in **extract_tweet.py**
